model color is determine by immmigration rate if immigration is equal to 1 then
the color well be darkred.
to choose a color for the line in the graph
  53) list of inds and asignned it the variable of i1
  54) list of sick and asignned it the variable of i1
  55) list of x_coords and asignned it the variable of i1
  56) list of y_coords and asignned it the variable of i1
  we assigned the list new variable because we do not want them to point at the same data
67) randomly choice a number between 0 and 1
  68) if x equal one
  69) list of sick is gonna be extend by val list
  70)  max1 is a unique ID; get the max number of inds and assign it to max1
  71) extend i1 by max1 which has assigned value of max(inds)
we return i1, s1, x1 and y1  as we dont want the came data from the other list
     they would both point at the same object
     92) list of inds and assigne it the variable of i1
93) list of sick and assigned it the variable of s1
94) list of x_coords and assign it the variable of x1
95) list of y_coords and assin it the variable of y
100) randomly choice 1 or 0
101) if x is choosen then
102) in list of i1 take out index (0)
103) in list of s1 take out index (0)
106) if the disease is HantaVirus then follow these parameters
107) The disease life span will be between 14 and 21 days 
108) The possible of dying from HantaVirus ranging from 33% to 50% than with
     disease life span we will divide it to get mortality rate for the individuals
109) at random choose a 1 or the variable of p and assign it to x
115) we return i1, s1, x1 and y1 as we dont want the came data from the other list
       they would both point at the same object
137) randomly choose an individuals from the inds list and assign it the variable 
     i1
138) randomly choose an individuals from the inds list and assign it the variable 
     i2
140) get the x coordinates for i1 from the x_coords list and assign the value to
     variable x1
141) get the x coordinates for i2 from the x_coords list and assign the value to
     variable x2
142) get the y coordinates for i1 from the y_coords list and assign the value to
     variable y1
143) get the y coordinates for i2 from the y_coords list and assign the value to
     variable y2 
146) Use the Pythagorean Theorem to get the distance betwwen i1 and i2 then assign 
     that value to the variable of D meaning distance
147) 1/(1+D) is to get the probably of getting infected affected by distance with
     the value we assign it the variable of pad which means "Probably Affected by 
     Distance" 
149) use the value that was assigned to variable "inf" multipy it by the value that
     was assigned to pad. Assign that value to variable "pof" which means "Probably 
     Of Infection" It well be a number between 0 and 1 but never going above 1 or below 0 
152) 4 is the radius of every individuals.
153) multiply 2 by the variable r than assign the value to the variable R
200) randomly choose a 1 or 0, it affected by the rec list 
201) if x equal 1 then get the sick individuals and cure it from the disease
204) randomly choose a number between 14 and 21. This is how long HantaVirus last
205) randomly choice a number betweem 0.33 to 0.5 that use the variable "rec" to 
     to get the probably of recovering from HantaVirus
167) for the range of sick use length for a loop
168) randomly choose a number between 0 and the length of inds
169) x_coords[i] += uniform(-1, 1) # += is a shortcut for x = x + y
170) y_coords[i] += uniform(-1, 1) # += is a shortcut for y = x + y
181) get the range from 11 (0, 1, 2, ..., 10). 11 is not included take the range
     then turn that in that into a list. Assign the variable of ms
202) open mydir open SimData open inds_data.cvs, Write
     and create a file named inds_data.txt
203) always closed the file that was just open
212) open mydir open SimData open sick_data.cvs, Write
     and create a file named sick_data.txt
213) always closed the file that was just open
'''
221) open mydir open SimData open x_coords_data.cvs, Write and create a file named
     x_coords_data.txt
222) always closed the file that was just open
231) open mydir open SimData open y_coords_data.cvs, Write and create a file named 
     y_coords_data.txt
232) always closed the file that was just open
240) open mydir open SimData open Complied_Data.cvs, Write and create a file named 
     y_coords_data.txt
241) 
241) always closed the file that was just open
253) range of 0 to 999 does not include 1000
  210) inds is a list from 0 to 999, where values are individual IDs
  286) have x_oords list be for 0 to the lsit of individual
  287) have y_coords list be for 0 to the list of individual
